
Here are some advices to reset your toner chip with an Arduino.

# Motivation

Your printer doesnÂ´t know how much capacity if left in you toner
cartridge. There is no sensor inside. Instead, your printer simply
record how much you print in a chip of the toner carriage. It will
then refuse to print when a pre-defined software limit is reached.

If you can make your printer believe the toner carriage is brand new
(while it isn't), you can force it to print more. This is what this
guide does.

Before your start, beware that some printers offer the functionality
(reset the toner chip) via a
[hidden menu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6lsUBu1TDg).

# Introduction

Some printer toner comes with a small circuit like:

![Picture of toner](images/sp112_toner.png)

In order to reuse this kind of toner, there are two steps:

1. refill the toner with ink (if needed)
2. reset the toner chip (or replace it)

There is [plenty of information](www.uni-kit.com/pdf/tonerrefillinstructions.pdf) explaining how to refill the
toner but little information on how to erase the toner chip.

This document deals with the second part: how to analyse the chip and
reset it.

It took me a while to get everything setup and to have my toner chip
reset so i would like to share this process in order to help other to
do the same on their printer.

We will go step-by-step to understand the problem, analyse the
circuit, read the chip memory and write it back so the toner can
function again.

For more information about why manufaturer include those chips, read
the [about page](ABOUT.md).

# Step 0: the problem

Your computer talks to your printer via a USB link (or maybe through
wifi). The printer itself communicate with the toner chip via an I2C
or a SPI bus.

	+------------+           +-----------+            +-------------+
	|    Host    |    USB    |           |    I2C     |    toner    |
	|  computer  | <-------> |  Printer  | <--------> |    chip     |
	|            |           |           |            |             |
	+------------+           +-----------+            +-------------+

So what we will do is to connect our Arduino directly to the toner
chip like this:

	+-----------+          +-----------+
	|           |   I2C    |   toner   |
	|  Arduino  | <------> |   chip    |
	|           |          |           |
	+-----------+          +-----------+


IC2 buses are very common on embedded systems. For example,
smartphones use them to connect the touchscreen or the motion sensor
to the main processor chip. There is plenty of documentation, i like
[this one from saleae](http://support.saleae.com/hc/en-us/articles/200730905-Learn-I2C-Inter-Integrated-Circuit).

The full specification is avavailable at: http://www.i2c-bus.org/

For your particalar printer, it might be an SPI bus instead of an I2C
bus. But this does not really matter: the analysis procedure is the
same.

# Step 1: the circuit

The first step is to analyse the circuit. Here you should gather as
much information as you can:

* Read the part number and search it on the Internet.
* Search if other people have shared information about your printer.

In my case, the chip looked like an EEPROM memory. This is was
confirmed by two blogs discussing other model Ricoh printers:

* http://www.mikrocontroller.net/topic/369267
* https://esdblog.org/ricoh-sp-c250dn-laser-printer-toner-hack/

I still could not find the exact EERPOM model, but it is of the 24xxx
family.

Your particular circuit will be different from this one.

If you have absolutly no idea, jump to the section: "Bonus 1: snif the
I2C commands" at the end of this page.

The rest of the tutorial is about how to read and write this EEPROM
memory.

Step 2: connect your Arduino
============================

Depending on the board the I2C pins are:

| Board         |   I2C pins           |
| :--:          | :--:                 |
| Uno, Ethernet |   A4 (SDA), A5 (SCL) |
| Mega2560      |   20 (SDA), 21 (SCL) |
| Due           |   20 (SDA), 21 (SCL) |
| Leonardo      |   2 (SDA), 3 (SCL)   |

Then connect GND and VCC to 3.3V.


Step 3: find the I2C clock and address
======================================

To communicate on an I2C bus, we need to know the clock speed and the
address of the EEPROM.

If you know the EEPROM model from the circuit analysis, you can
read the datasheet and find the clock rate and address like this:

For example the [datasheet of the component FM24C02B](datasheet/FM24C02B-04B-08B-16B.pdf)
indicates an operating clock of 1MHz at 3.3V.
The datasheet indicates how to calculate the address according to the
PIN A0, A1 and A2. In binary, the address is computed like this: ``1 0
1 0 A2 A1 A0``.

So if the configuration is:

	A0 = 1
	A1 = 1
	A2 = 0

The address is ``1 0 1 0 0 1 1`` (83).

Note: 1MHz seems to be the upper bound of the my Arduino Mega can reach.
So I just use 800 kHz, see the [full discussion](http://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/29457/how-to-make-arduino-do-high-speed-i2c).

If you don't know the clock rate and the device address on the I2C
bus, you can scan all the possible I2C addresses at different clock
rate. The directory scanner have a sketch to do this. Here is the
output of the program execution on my Arduino:

	Arduino I2C Scanner - 0.1.06

	Scanmode:
		s = single scan
		c = continuous scan - 1 second delay
		q = quit continuous scan
		d = toggle latency delay between successful tests. 0 - 5 ms
	Output:
		p = toggle printAll - printFound.
		h = toggle header - noHeader.
		a = toggle address range, 0..127 - 8..120
	Speeds:
		0 = 50 - 800 Khz
		1 = 100 KHz only
		2 = 200 KHz only
		4 = 400 KHz only
		8 = 800 KHz only

		? = help - this page

	3322	127	0x7F		.	.	.	.	.	.	. 

	1 device find in 347 milliseconds.


From here, we know the device address on the I2C bus is 83 (0x53) and
the operating clock is anything between 50 kHz and 800 kHz.


Step 4: reading the EEPROM
==========================

Since we know how to communicate with the chip, let's read the content
of the memory. For 24xxx EEPROM, the [datasheet for FM24C02B](datasheet/FM24C02B-04B-08B-16B.pdf) explains how to complete a read operation:

	master send start condition
	master send eeprom address + read bit
	master send data address
	master send start condition
	master send eeprom address + read bit
	device respond with data
	master send stop condition

	STOP condition mandatory between writes.
	Write cycle: 5 ms.

The function "printRandomAddress" of the Reset.ino sketch implements
this random read operation. Once the read operation works, you can
print each bytes of the EEPROM one by one and save them in a file.

```sh
	$ head dump.txt
	0x20
	0x0
	0x1
	0x3
	0x1
	0x1
	0x3
	0x0
	0x0
	0x0
```

Next I converted the text file into a binary format. I found binary
format easier to analyze with xxd:

	$ head -n 256 dump.txt | xargs printf "%02x\n" | xxd -c 1 -p -r > dump.bin
	$ xxd dump.bin
	00000000: 2000 0103 0101 0300 0000 ffff ffff ffff   ...............
	00000010: 1504 4d47 2700 1882 0000 0000 2000 0101  ..MG'....... ...
	00000020: 5830 3235 4d34 3331 3536 3620 0045 0000  X025M431566 .E..
	00000030: 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0106 0000 0000  ................

	00000060: 0000 0000 0000 0000 0106 0000 0000 0000  ................
	00000070: 000e 715d 1000 1427 0000 0000 0000 0000  ..q]...'........
	00000080: ffff ffff ffff ffff ffff ffff ffff ffff  ................
	00000090: ffff ffff ffff ffff ffff ffff ffff ffff  ................
	000000a0: ffff ffff ffff ffff ffff ffff ffff ffff  ................
	000000b0: ffff ffff ffff ffff ffff ffff ffff ffff  ................
	000000c0: ffff ffff ffff ffff ffff ffff ffff ffff  ................
	000000d0: ffff ffff ffff ffff ffff ffff ffff ffff  ................
	000000e0: ffff ffff ffff ffff ffff ffff ffff ffff  ................
	000000f0: ffff ffff ffff ffff ffff ffff ffff ffff  ................

Here we can see:

* there seems to be a header (0x0 to 0x0f),
* followed by some numbers (0x10 to 0x1f),
* followed by a string (X025M431566)
* followed by some sparse values

This does not make much sense. The next step is to figure out what
those values are for.

Step 5: understand the data
===========================

In order to understand the memory layout, we have to think like a
detective.

The EEPROM is a simple data storage. The printer might wants to:

* read the toner model (to check compatibility)
* store the number of printed pages and/or the number of printed dot
* mark is as used by a particular printer to prevent second hand market
* mark the date of the first and last usage to make it out of date.
* store toner capacity of page and 'dot' (can be a cound down value).

This is purely speculative at this stage.

In the search for evidences, we can capture the USB packet sent by the
computer to the printer. Thanks to tcpdump, this is very easy (see
"Bonus 2: snif the USB packets").

My particular printer uses 
[Printer Job Language: PJL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printer_Job_Language).
Here is a data transfered over USB when I print a page:

	%-12345X@PJL
	@PJL SET TIMESTAMP=2015/09/14 21:15:14
	@PJL SET FILENAME=test - Notepad
	@PJL SET COMPRESS=JBIG
	@PJL SET USERNAME=IEUser
	@PJL SET COVER=OFF
	@PJL SET HOLD=OFF
	@PJL SET PAGESTATUS=START
	@PJL SET COPIES=1
	@PJL SET MEDIASOURCE=TRAY1
	@PJL SET MEDIATYPE=PLAINRECYCLE
	@PJL SET PAPER=LETTER
	@PJL SET PAPERWIDTH=5100
	@PJL SET PAPERLENGTH=6600
	@PJL SET RESOLUTION=600
	@PJL SET IMAGELEN=691
	[... image data ... ]
	@PJL SET DOTCOUNT=10745
	@PJL SET PAGESTATUS=END
	@PJL EOJ
	%-12345X

The important piece of information are:

* the DOTCOUNT value
* the TIMESTAMP value

One note about dates: To implement a simple 'out of date' mechanism,
year/mount/day is enough. But if the toner needs to warm-up or cool
down hours/minutes/seconds might also required. 2016 converted to
hexadecimal is 7E0. Be aware of Unix epoch format. It is well suited
for this need. Here is an example of a date in hexadecimal values:

	$ date --date='@1456056478'
	Sun Feb 21 13:07:58 CET 2016
	$ echo "obase=16; 1456056478" | bc
	56C9A89E

32 bits is enough to live until 2038, which certainly exceeded the expected
life of such product.

To recap, we can expect the following informations in the EEPROM
memory:

* a standard header to verify if the EEPROM is correctly workding
* a part number for model compatibility
* a status/error value (to signal when the toner has caused a problem)
* a 'dot' count number (and/or the number of printed pages)
* a maximum 'dot' capacity (and/or the maximum number of pages to print)
* a last used date field (and/or a first used data field)

Unfortunatly, I was not able to figure out the memory layout but I
wish you better luck! 

Step 6: try some changes
========================

If you are lucky enough that your toner chip is still working (printing), 
you can dump the content of the EEPROM before and after printing a
page. This might give you clues about the memory layout.

The process is like this:

* read the EEPROM content
* make some changes base on an hypothesis
* write the content into the EEPROM
* try to print a page and restart if this does not work.

In order to speed-up the process, i directly connect my Arduino to the
chip inside the printer so i do not need to manipulate the printer
during the experiments.

![Picture working installation](images/final_setup.jpg)

As for me, i try a couple of random changes without success.
Then i had the idea to erase all the memory except the addresses 0x0
to 0x0f and it worked!

Another advantage of the binary data: with xxd you can convert the
binary data into a C header file. This C header file can be included
in your program.

	$ xxd -i dump.bin | tee dump_bin.h
	unsigned char dump_bin[] = {
	  0x20, 0x00, 0x01, 0x03, 0x01, 0x01, 0x03, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0xff, 0xff,

	  0xff, 0xff, 0xff, 0xff
	};
	unsigned int dump_bin_len = 256;


Step 7: share your findings
===========================

Congrats! You have done some work, collected some information and get
a better understanding of your toner chip. Let the world know
about your findings and learn from others!


Bonus 1: snif the I2C commands
=============================

One way to gain some insight about the memory layout, is to spy the
communication between the printer and the toner during the printing
processus.

In order to do so, we can use a logical analyser. This is a simple
equipement that will record the logical state of the wires.


	+------------+           +-----------+            +-------------+
	|    Host    |    USB    |           |    I2C     |    toner    |
	|  computer  | <-------> |  Printer  | <--------> |    chip     |
	|            |           |           |      ^     |             |
	+------------+           +-----------+      |     +-------------+
	                                            |
	                                        logical
	                                        analyser

This can be very useful to learn:

* the general properties of the communication (type of
  bus, clock speed, device address).
* what memory address the printer read and write

The main open source project to use logical analysers is
[Sigrok](http://sigrok.org). For the list of supported analysers
please refer to [supported hardware page](https://sigrok.org/wiki/Supported_hardware).

The following pictures explain the settings:

1. attach the wires to the circuit and put back the circuit on the
   toner in the printer.
2. connect the logical analyzer.

![Picture back circuit](images/back_circuit.jpg)

![Picture logical analyzer printer](images/logical_analyser.jpg)

To capture the data transfert, you can use a graphical tool
like [Pulseview](https://sigrok.org/wiki/PulseView).

![Picture of Pulseview interface](pulseview/capture_eeprom.png)

You can also use the command line tool called
[sigrok-cli](https://sigrok.org/wiki/Sigrok-cli) as demonstrated
bellow:


```sh
	$ sigrok-cli -i start_printer_failed.sr -P i2c:scl=2:sda=3,eeprom24xx
	Control code bits: 1010
	Address bit 2: 0

How to read this: one sequential read of the content of the eeprom,
followed by a sequence of write operations: 4 byte at 0x70, 1 byte at
0x76. This the printer read all the eeprom, it is difficult to figure
out which address hold which information.


Bonus 2: snif the USB packets
============================

Here is an example of USB command sent by the proprietary windows
driver to the printer (captured with tcpdump when running windows
inside qemu):

Ricoh SP112 LED
===============

	Left LED: Power Indicator
	This indicator lights up blue when the machine is turned on.
	It flashes when a print job is received and while printing is in progress.

	Right LED: Alert Indicator
	This indicator lights up red when the machine runs out of paper or consumables,
	when the paper settings do match the settings specified by the driver,
	or when other abnormalities occur.
